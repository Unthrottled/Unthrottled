Questions that keep me up a night:
   
• What's truly essential and what is not important?
• Why do I like minimalist art so much? 🎨
• Will I ever get tired of being a weeb?
• Can you really have too much of a good thing?
• When will my gains plateau? 😨
• How can I bring joy and make others days better?
• Why I am I learning chinese when I live in the middle of of the US?
• Will I die if I don't check my email at least once a day?
• Why is it so hard to get to sleep?! 🤔
