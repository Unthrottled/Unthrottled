Questions I ask myself sometimes:
   
- What's truly essential and what is not important?
- Why minimalist art so good?
- Will I ever get tired of being a weeb?
- Can you really have too much of a good thing?
- How long can I keep making gainz?
- How can I bring joy and make others days better?
- 我住在中美国，为什么学习汉语吗?
- Will I die if I don't check my email at least once a day?
